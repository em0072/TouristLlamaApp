**Purpose & Functionality**\n

No booking services for flights, hotels, or tours are provided by the app.\n

Users must be 18 years or older to create an account on Tourist Llama. A verified email address is necessary for security purposes.\n
**Monetization & Fees**\n
Currently, all features of Tourist Llama are available free of charge. However, certain features, both existing and new, may become paid in the future.\n
**User Data & Privacy**\n
We collect user names, email addresses, profile pictures, and travel plan information. This data is stored securely on servers located inside the EU. It is used to facilitate the app's functionalities. Anonymized data, used for analytical purposes, is shared with the Google Analytics service. Personal data is not shared with third parties.\n
